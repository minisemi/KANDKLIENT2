<h>Created this app as a part of my bachelors project (kandidatarbete). The app is unfortunately really server-dependant and since the
server and database was shut down by my university after the project was completed, we no longer have access to it. Hence the majority
of the functions no longer work. The server code is maintained in another repository.</h>

<p>The app is meant to function as a help tool for firemen in the field. A user first logs in with a valid NFC-card, but for demonstration
purposes I also implemented an invisible button in the middle of the screen on the enlarged icon-image which doesn't require a valid NFC-card.
The app then has different functions to prove the app's requirements (funktionella och icke-funktionella krav) which were demanded by
my teachers. The functions include:
<ul>
<li> a map which has editable markers which can be synced and seen by other logged in users</li>
<li> videocommunication with other logged in users using WebRTC</li>
<li> a voting system with a sender and receiver that can send encrypted and non-encrypted votes using a combination of RSA and AES with onion routing</li>
</ul>
